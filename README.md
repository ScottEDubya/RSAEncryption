# RSAEncryption
A program to calculate a private and public key for the RSA Encryption algorithm

The program randomly generates two prime numbers of the specified size by using fermats test, saves them to a text file,
then uses those numbers to establish public and private keys based on the RSA algorithm. The keys are saved into two text
files for use later.
